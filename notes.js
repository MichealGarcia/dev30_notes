// The 7 Data Types

// There are 6 *Primitive data types.
// Primitive data types are the building block for all kother data types
// They are the most basic form of data.

// Primitives.
null //null means nothing, absence of value
undefined // a variable with no assigned value
// Some might say that null and undefined is the same, but 
// one is the value of nothing, the other has no defined value.
true false // These are boolean values, true or false
123456 // number, its numbers
"Strings" // Strings is text or seen as text (string)
// symbol // is made with a built in object, and it is gauranteed
// to be unique. i.e. if you declare two variables with the same
// symbol, they will not equal each other.
// Often used to add unique property keys to an object that wont
// collide with keys any other code might add to an object

// Complex data type
// Object
// It is used to store various keyed collections and complex entities.
// Key: Value pairs, these are essentially objects.
// Say you have a car object, its color: red, speed: 'fast', etc.


// Declaring Variables

// var, let, const
// let and const are more complicated on the topic of scope.
// so just understand that they are all used for declarations of variables.
// var was the only way to declare variables in the past (pre 2015)
// you can't reassign a const variable.
